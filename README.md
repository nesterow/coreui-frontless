# Frontless + CoreUI 2 Dashboard

A starting point with [Frontless](https://frontless.js.org/) and Bootstrap4 based user interfaces.
Features [CoreUI 2](https://github.com/coreui/coreui) and User Authentication.

## Features

- User registration/login
- CoreUI Application Layout
- Bootstrap4 + JQuery

## Goals

Some components from CoreUI will be ported to Riot.JS, however this template will always rely on JQuery and Bootstrap 4.
